<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi, I'm Junrey Paracuelles

<p>I'm an aspiring web developer with a diverse background and a passion for learning new skills.<br/>
 Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development, eager to fuse my extensive experience<br/>
  in engineering and various trades to create innovative web-based automation solutions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Before embarking on this journey, I spent 13 years in the field of computer-aided roof measurements,<br/>
where I specialized in analyzing satellite images to measure roof areas accurately. This role honed <br/>
my attention to detail and strengthened my analytical skills. Additionally, I am a junior car air condition<br/>
technician, leveraging my strong background in engineering and science to solve technical problems effectively.<br/>
</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I've worn many hats and tackled various challenges, making me a true jack of all trades.<br/> 
My goal is to integrate my electronics expertise, engineering knowledge, and agricultural insights to develop<br/>
 cutting-edge web applications that revolutionize automation.<br/>
</p>

<p>
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, tinkering with electronics, or expanding my knowledge<br/>
 in agriculture. These interests not only keep me engaged but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving abilities.<br/>
